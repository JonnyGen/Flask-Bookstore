
The Math Marathon
Jon slouched in his chair, staring blankly at the math problems on his desk. Numbers and equations swirled in his mind, blending into an incomprehensible mess. His teacher’s voice was just background noise as he fought to keep his eyes open. The bell rang, signaling the end of class, and Jon let out a frustrated sigh. He shoved his notebook into his backpack and trudged out of the classroom.

In the hallway, James noticed Jon’s dejected expression. “Hey, Jon, you okay?”

Jon shrugged. “I just don’t get this. Math is impossible.”

Susan, who had been walking with James, overheard and joined the conversation. “What’s giving you trouble?” she asked.

“Everything,” Jon replied. “I can’t make sense of any of it.”

Susan smiled encouragingly. “You can do it, Jon. Let’s tackle it together.”

That afternoon, they gathered in the library. Susan spread out their textbooks and notebooks on a large table. “Alright, let’s start with the basics,” she said. “What exactly don’t you understand?”

Jon sighed again, feeling overwhelmed. “Pretty much everything. Fractions, decimals, algebra...”

James nodded sympathetically. “Math can be tough, but we’ll help you. Let’s take it one step at a time.”

They started with fractions, breaking down the problems into smaller, more manageable pieces. Susan explained the concepts patiently, using visual aids and real-life examples. James turned it into a game, competing to solve problems the fastest. As they worked together, Jon began to see patterns and connections that had eluded him before.

Days turned into weeks, and Jon’s confidence grew. He no longer dreaded math class; in fact, he started to enjoy the challenge. He practiced regularly, and with Susan and James’s support, he improved steadily.

When the next math test came around, Jon approached it with a mixture of nerves and excitement. He took his time, carefully working through each problem. When the test was handed back, he could hardly believe his eyes: he had scored higher than he ever had before.

“Thanks, guys,” Jon said, grinning. “I couldn’t have done it without you.”

Susan and James smiled back. “We knew you could do it,” Susan said. “You just needed a little help.”

“Yeah,” James added. “And remember, we’re always here for you.”
